I enjoy building things end-to-end — from scalable full-stack applications to reinforcement learning agents and robotic control systems.  My academic background at Sapienza University of Rome, combined with hands-on projects in React/Node, distributed systems, PyTorch, and ROS2, shaped me into an engineer who cares about clean architecture, performance and practical problem-solving."
